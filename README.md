<h2> Introduction </h2> 

Ever growing memes, news, articles, if there is one of the topics that worldwide gets attention is the housing market. We all see how it gets more and more expensive, the news on empty houses and market speculation, the lack of builiding and polititian promises around it. In this small article with these questions on mind we decided to experiment a bit with a large dataset regarding the housing market in Germany (pre 2020) and see what new insights we could get from actual data.

Particulary we would like to answer some of these questions:

* Is the rental price significantly different between the Bundesl√§nder?
* what is the mean rental price for the country?
* what variables influence the price slightly or heavily?
